# Redirect rule example
# For more information see:- https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/

# The default HTTP status code is 301, but you can define a different one e.g.
# status = 302

# Headers rule example
# For more information see:- https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/

#[[headers]]
#   Define which paths this specific [[headers]] block will cover.
#   for = "/*"

#[headers.values]
#   X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
#   X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
#   Content-Security-Policy = "frame-ancestors https://www.facebook.com"

# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds â€“ they do not get scoped to
# contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files, which are
# applied on a PER-DEPLOY basis.
