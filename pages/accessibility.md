## Measures To Support Accessibility

Luna Bee Web Development takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of Luna Bee Web Development:

- Include accessibility as part of our mission statement.
- Employ formal accessibility quality assurance methods.

## Conformance Status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Luna Bee Web Development is partially conformant with WCAG 2.2 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

## Additional Accessibility Considerations

My goal is always to meet at least WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance, and I will continually shoot for Level AAA Success. If parts of this site do not meet your accessibility usage requirements or standards, feel free to reach out and contact me for remediation and fixes.
