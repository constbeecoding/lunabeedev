## Some Background

I've worked since I was a teenager—fast food, babysitting, retail, you name it. I come from a blended family of 6, in a small town with a graduating class of less than 100 students. My stepmother worked hard to raise 4 children on a music teacher's salary. I graduated high school in 2009, which [is still historically one of the worst years to have entered the job force as an adult](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/01/2009_was_worst_year_in_decades.html "NPR Article about Wages and Benefits in 2009"). My childhood wasn't without difficulties but it helped shape me into the person I am today.

College wasn't affordable for me or my family, so when I moved out at 18 years old, I started at a technical school to take advantage of the A+ program which paid for my first two years of college for free, and eventually earned a Bachelor's in Japanese Language and TESOL at my state university, even studying abroad in Tokyo for 7 months with the [Gilman Scholarship](https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/ "Gilman Scholarship Homepage"). This reignited my love of travel, meeting new people whilst traveling and learning about different cultures, a wanderlust which persists to this day. Like every other millenial, I had hoped my college degree was the path out of poverty.

My dreams of teaching English in Japan shifted when the market changed and English teaching jobs dried up, so I worked at Starbucks as a Barista and Trainer until landing my first office admin role via referral from a friend. I worked my way up, and eventually became a Financial Manager for the same nonprofit serving people with developmental disabilities.

THIS was where my career pivoted into tech and the hope of a life full of travel began.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Working with clients who had disabilities opened my eyes to how technology can transform lives—when it's built inclusively. The keyboard I'm typing on, ramps, texting, video calls—all encompass the [Curb-Cut effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect "Wikipedia Article on the Curb Cut Effect"), which you may have heard before. Technologies designed for specific communities end up benefiting everyone and pushing society forward.

I watched low-vision clients navigate smartphones with screen readers and saw the incredible potential when technology works as it should. I also witnessed gaps—like companies lacking video call services for ASL communication—like the bank that demanded I "put the deaf client on the phone." rather than offer video call services where they can use ASL to communicate. Time after time, I encountered barriers that shouldn't exist even on the most basic company, state, and government websites. I had so many questions: Who builds inaccessible products? How can I be part of the solution? Some google-fu showed me, most of the solution involved code.

## The Pivot: Learning to Code

When COVID-19 hit in 2020, I was an essential worker, as we offered in-home health services for the community I served, who suddenly had all this free time after work. After recovering from a severe case of COVID (pre-vaccine availability), I decided to invest some of my income that I was saving, due to being isolated at home, into learning front-end web development. My goal: build a more accessible web while creating new opportunities and a better life for myself.

Using [Treehouse Tech](https://teamtreehouse.com/ "Learn to Code Online with Treehouse Tech"), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn "Learn to Code with freeCodeCamp") and other affordable resources, I studied for two hours every night after work. Every Saturday, I joined a Zoom accountability group with other women breaking into tech. For months of monotony, I applied to hundreds of positions, collected rejection and feedback emails, and kept pushing.

Eventually, Cullen, Co-Founder of [Matchbox Design Group](https://matchboxdesigngroup.com/ "Matchbox Design Group Website") found my profile through [Out In Tech](https://outintech.com/ "Out In Tech Website")—an organization dedicated to lifting up LGBTQ identities in tech. I'd been volunteering with them quarterly, building free WordPress sites for organizations in countries where being LGBTQ is criminalized. An organization I'm proud to be a part of to this day.

This was my first break into tech.

## Finding My Place

Matchbox was fast-paced and challenging, exactly what I needed to grow. I'm grateful they took a chance on me. I met brilliant women in tech who became friends, mentors, and teachers and with whom I'm friends with to this day. They encouraged me to apply for a full time position at [2Barrels](https://www.twobarrels.com/who-we-are/luna/ "Two Barrels Website") (now merged with [Corporate Tools](https://www.corporatetools.com/ "Corporate Tools Website")).

I finally thrived. I worked on major projects like the [Registered Agents Inc.](https://www.registeredagentsinc.com/ "Registered Agents Inc. Homepage") redesign and [domains product feature](https://www.registeredagentsinc.com/domain-name/ "Domains from Registered Agents Inc."). I became a trusted accessibility resource.

Here was my main project prior to the redesign:

And here is the after (quite the effort and transformation):

After 3.5 years, I'd moved to Denver, Colorado in June 2025 to start my journey as a digital nomad—exploring the U.S. while coding, feeling aligned with who I am and where I wanted to go. I also felt accepted within my LGBT identity in the workplace alongside others in my community.

Then came October 9th, 2025.

## The Pivot Point

That Thursday morning, I was working on a site modernization project when all meetings were suddenly cancelled except one. At 9:30am, 130 of us learned our positions were being eliminated, effective immediately. No warning, no transition period—just a severance package and revoked system access. The site I was working on was in progress and would have been the second site overhaul I'd worked on. The first one, referenced above, [Registered Agents Inc.](https://www.registeredagentsinc.com/ "Registered Agents Inc. Homepage").

The layoff was a gut punch. I'd been working toward a promotion for over a year. Leadership had assured us just a week prior that layoffs weren't expected. Colleagues with 3-8 years of tenure were let go alongside me. It wasn't my direct lead's or manager's fault, they learned of the layoff simultaneously as we did. It was entirely from the top, the CEO, Financial, etc.

**Here's what I learned:** this is happening everywhere, I'm not alone. I heard from people who'd just had a baby, bought homes, signed leases. The tech industry is going through massive shifts, and many talented people are navigating this same challenge as we enter a recession.

## Moving Forward with Purpose

You can say, "That's just business for you.", "It happens." Yes, you are correct. This is not unique to me or the company I worked for, I'm not special. However, I refuse to accept that this is just the way it is now. We simply shouldn't treat each other in this manner. Business or not.

To those who uphold these systems: execs, CEOS, HR, and management; I don't begrudge you for also having to feed your family and pay bills. I do hope that the shame of upholding these systems, leaving your integrity and dignity at the door, whilst making the choice to layoff your colleagues in this fashion, via mass layoff call, haunts you.

This experience has given me clarity about what truly matters. I'm taking direct action.

**Immediate Steps:**

- Updated my website (thanks for being here!), [portfolio](/work/index.html "Luna's Portfolio"), [resume](/resume/index.html "Luna's Resume"), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lunabee/ "Luna's LinkedIn Profile")
- Applying strategically to companies aligned with my values
- Leveraging my network and resources (including Out In Tech)
- Open to contract work, freelance opportunities, and barista shifts if needed—I've hustled before, I can do it again

**What I'm Looking For:**

- Companies that foster learning and continuing education
- Teams that support LGBTQ employees and prioritize accessibility
- Cultures that value work-life balance and understand that happier workers are more productive
- Companies that don't baulk at you if you are a traveler
- Organizations that see employees as human beings, not just resources

**What I'm Building:**

In this space, I'm continuing to create projects I love, learn new coding languages, and advocate for web accessibility. I'm documenting my journey—the applications, the interviews, the wins, code, and the lessons learned. If you're going through something similar, you're not alone.

**What This Means for My Work:**

This setback is a redirection, not an end. I'm more committed than ever to:

- Building accessible, inclusive web experiences
- Connecting with communities that value humanity in tech
- Creating work that reflects my values: family, friends, travel, freedom, inclusion, and resilience

I'm excited about what's next, even if I don't know exactly what it looks like yet. The skills I've built, the connections I've made, and the determination that got me into tech in the first place? Those haven't gone anywhere.

If you're hiring, looking for accessibility expertise, or know someone who is—I'd love to connect. And if you're going through your own career transition, let's support each other.

Thank you for reading, and for being part of this journey.
